### Changes:

* Added Cyrillic alphabet (uppercase only for now)

* Added Greek alphabet (uppercase only for now)

* Copied Latin letters to accented Latin (no changes {for now?})

* **Moved some punctuation marks to** (in my opinion) **more sensible locations**

  > (this was done as i found myself writing of lot of `str.replace(" ", "!")`)

  * " " - u0020: now the same width as the characters, taking the place of Exclam
  * ; - u003B: now the blank alternative to :, taking the place of Space
  * ! - now lower colon dot, taking the place of Hash/Octothorpe (mirroring ¬°, upper colon dot)
  * \# - now fully filled character, taking the place of tilde
  * ~ - now duplicate of hyphen

* Added some auxiliary Latin letters

  * √Ü, √¶ - u00C6, u00E6
  * ≈í, ≈ì, - u0152, u0153
  * √ê, √∞ - u00D0, u00F0
  * √ò, √∏ - u00D8, u00F8
  * √ü - u00DF

* Added/changed various less significant punctuation marks:

  * ¬∂ (pilcrow)
  * ¬¢ (cent mark)
  * ‚Ç© (won sign)

* Changed the form of some characters 

  > (keshikan's version available at uFF10 ‚Äì uFF5E, fullwidth latin block)

  * S - u0053: reverted to older form
  *  " - u0022: changed to vertical (caron form is available at u21E9, downwards white arrow)

  * i - u0069: added tittle
  * j - u006A: changed form, added tittle
  * w - u0077: changed to rounded form

### additionally, changed to semantic versioning system, as i find that easier to deal with

* Add glyphs for √∞, √æ, √û, ‚Ç§, ‚Ç¨,
